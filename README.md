# Problem Statement
Our electronic consumer business faces competitive challenges and declining profitability due to a lack of clear insights from our extensive sales data. We urgently need to understand evolving customer behaviors, product performance, and market trends to regain our competitive edge and drive strategic growth.

**Task**
- Sales & Profitability Trends: Identify which products, categories, and sales channels are driving our revenue and profit, and analyze their performance trends over time?
- Customer Segmentation: Understand distinct customer groups based on their purchasing habits and demographics to tailor marketing and sales efforts?
- Product Performance Lifecycle: Evaluate product success from launch to decline, pinpointing key factors that influence their market acceptance and longevity?
- Market & Seasonal Fluctuations: Uncover significant seasonal sales patterns and emerging consumer preferences to optimize inventory and marketing timing?
-Inventory Optimization: Assess inventory levels against sales velocity to minimize costs from overstocking and prevent lost sales from stock-outs.
